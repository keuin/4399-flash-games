- Intention

This repository collects some classical flash games which were popular in China, in the first decade of 21 century.

If you wish a certain game which is not included now, please open an issue and describe what you want, or open a pull-request to submit the files you've found.

- Files

flash-player: standalone flash player (*.exe), ActiveX flash player (for IE)
games: *.swf files

- Secuity Concern

Some files have been lost in the rapid evolution of Internet. I will try my best to obtain files from the most reilable source which is available. If the original publisher is not available, files from Web Archiver and some reputable downloading sites will also be considered. File sources will be noted in README files along with them.
